# Introducing *Guru Does It For You*

It might feel like we've been hibernating for the past few months but we do have a few exciting things about to happen! This week, we're announcing *Guru Does It For You* - boost your monthly AppointmentGuru subscription with your own dedicated Guru. We can help keep your business running like a machine by doing a varied bunch of tasks (see below).

## Things we can do (and any others you can think of!):

1. Configure and tweak your AppointmentGuru account settings
2. Import existing clients and appointments
3. Manage your appointments for you
4. Reconcile paid invoices in AppointmentGuru so that you can send payment reminders and see accurate reporting
5. Create mail campaigns to your Clients
6. Link your Facebook page to AppointmentGuru
7. Help customise your free AppointmentGuru website or give you code for the booking widget to add to your own website
8. If you're looking for your own domain name and email address, we'll help get that done
9. Get your AppointmentGuru calendar synced to your phone
10. Access to logo, business card and flyer design

As we release more features, this list will grow! Keep updated on the [*Guru Does It For You*](/guru-does-it-for-you) page.

We always welcome feedback via [email](mailto:support@appointmentguru.co) or our [Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/appointmentguru/).
